    "ABC Logistics runs a cross-dock distribution facility with over 130 outbound docks. In recent months, productivity on the outbound docks has begun to hit a plateau, leading managers to look for new ways to promote associate productivity. The general policy for allocating associates to outbound doors has been to spread them evenly through the facility (i.e. each associate is assigned 5 doors). However, with volume in constant flux throughout the day and throughout the facility, this isn't practical when trying to maximize productivity. ABC Logistics would like to develop a model that can recommend allocation decisions to managers that minimize each associates deviation from a target. "
